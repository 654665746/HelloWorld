# This Program was drafted on October 16th, 2018, to test GitHub and get a free t-shirt for Hacktoberfest!

# This Program should output Hello, World! through Python, Java, or another language depending on which IDE I can get working. The Wi-Fi and VS are destroying the chances of a Java iteration occuring today, but tomorrow may yield improved results (October 16th, 2018)

The File is named as -copy since it was in an IdeaProjects folder and was copied into the same folder, as I was unsure if file upload would delete the file from my system or copy over to GitHub.
